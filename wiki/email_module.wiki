#summary Allows fields such as BCC, CC, Reply-to addresses, and others.  Also has an excellent debug mode, in which the extension does not actually send emails, but instead outputs it to the screen.

= Usage =

You can configure the extension as follows:
{{{
'components'=>array(
	'email'=>array(
		'class'=>'application.extensions.email.Email',
		'delivery'=>'php', //Will use the php mailing function.  
		//May also be set to 'debug' to instead dump the contents of the email into the view
	),
...
}}}

You need to put the debug widget somewhere in the view or layout, if you wish to use debug mode (already done in skeleton application)
{{{
$this->widget('application.extensions.email.Debug');
}}}
Example code:
{{{
$email = Yii::app()->email;
$email->to = 'admin@example.com';
$email->subject = 'Hello';
$email->message = 'Hello brother';
$email->send();
}}}

Instead of defining the message with `$email->message`, you could instead define a view (and layout if you wish) to use as the email content.  This is much more flexible and maintains MVC better.
