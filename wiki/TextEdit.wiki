#summary TextEdit is a module that supplies CMS like edit-in-place ajax functionality with markup syntax.

= Introduction =
To put a textual edit-in-place in a view, simply call this in the desired location:
{{{
$this->widget('application.modules.TextEdit.components.TextEditor', array('id'=>'unique id'));
}}}
Where the `id` attribute a unique id representing the text block.

If you are a regular user, it simply prints out the text block.  If you are an admin, it will be an edit-in-place text block (with ajax).

I had freelance clients in mind when creating this. They tend to like to tweak text blocks on their sites a lot...  This way they can do it themselves, and have fun, and love you.

Markup parsing is cached with [parsecache ParseCacheBehavior]

All edits are logged to a file under the `watch` level
